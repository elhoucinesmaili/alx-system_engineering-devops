Postmortem: The Great 502 DisasterIssue SummaryDuration: fev 14, 2025, 14:30 - 15:15 UTC (45 minutes)
Impact:
Our web application became inaccessible to 80% of users.
Users were greeted with a 502 Bad Gateway error.
API requests to backend services were timing out, causing disruptions in our service.
Root Cause:
A misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer caused it to direct traffic to an unhealthy upstream server, which resulted in failed requests and cascading failures across the system.
Timeline14:30 UTC: Automated monitoring alerts detected a surge in 502 Bad Gateway errors.
14:32 UTC: Engineers were paged and began investigating the logs.
14:35 UTC: Confirmed that the application servers were running but not responding to requests.
14:40 UTC: Initial assumption was a backend service crash; restarted services, but the issue persisted.
14:50 UTC: Misleading path: Checked database connections, assuming a slow query issue.
14:55 UTC: Noticed that Nginx logs showed upstream server errors, indicating a load balancer issue.
15:05 UTC: Found that Nginx was directing traffic to an unhealthy server.
15:10 UTC: Updated Nginx configuration to properly exclude the unhealthy server.
15:15 UTC: Traffic returned to normal, and the issue was marked as resolved.
Root Cause and ResolutionRoot Cause:The Nginx load balancer was set to use a static upstream server list instead of dynamic health checks. When one of the backend servers became unresponsive due to high memory usage, Nginx continued routing traffic to it instead of failing over to a healthy server.
Resolution:Modified Nginx configuration to use proxy_next_upstream directive to bypass failing upstream servers.
Restarted Nginx to apply the new configuration.
Implemented automatic health checks to dynamically exclude unresponsive servers.
Corrective and Preventative MeasuresImprovements:Improve monitoring to detect and alert on upstream server health.
Implement automated failover in case of unresponsive servers.
Ensure proper documentation and testing for Nginx configuration changes.
Action Items:✅ Configure Nginx to use health checks for upstream servers.✅ Add monitoring for upstream server health and response times.✅ Set up automatic failover for unresponsive servers.✅ Conduct load testing to prevent similar overload issues.✅ Review and update documentation on Nginx configuration best practices.
Final ThoughtsWhat started as a simple 502 error turned into a full-scale outage affecting thousands of users. However, through swift investigation and collaboration, we not only fixed the issue but also implemented solutions to prevent future occurrences. Lesson learned: Always have dynamic health checks enabled!
